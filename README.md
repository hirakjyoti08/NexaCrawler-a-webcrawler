**This is the code for a webcrawler named -NexaCrawler**

A web crawler is a software program that systematically browses the World Wide Web in an automated fashion. Its primary purpose is to gather information from websites by following hyperlinks from one page to another. Here I have tested it with a bookshop dummy website http://books.toscrape.com/.
